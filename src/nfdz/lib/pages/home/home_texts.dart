const String kHomePageFreelanceSummary1 = '''
I am confident to face specific projects alone and with remote groups.
I have used several online platforms and my networking in my city to get new projects.
I have done three projects related to the development of applications so far. These applications
needed the development of a backend (Python) and a backendless solution (Firebase).

const String kHomePageFreelanceSummary2 = '''
It is especially important for me to take care
of the first stage of planning and details to approach the project.
It is important that the client can see and understand the different stages of production and the
time of each stage.

const String kHomePageFreelanceSummary3 = '''
The first project was for a non-profit cultural association. We developed a platform to manage events,
people and loyalty. After finish and persuade the admin team, I published the code
under an open license in my <a href="https://github.com/nfdz/ClubApp" target="_blank">Github</a>
in order to show a nice Kotlin App and Firebase. Of course,
I would love that any association uses the platform.

const String kHomePageFreelanceSummary4 = '''
Another project that I would like to highlight is a tourism platform that I have developed using
Flutter framework. The development of apps for Android and iOS using Flutter is amazing.
I enjoyed the easy domain language every day and I save a lot of important time in development and
maintenance for this type of projects. This project uses the Firebase suite as backend solution.
Unfortunately I cannot provide the code since it is a private project but you can check the project
its <a href="https://evive.es/" target="_blank">website</a> and download the app in your app store.
